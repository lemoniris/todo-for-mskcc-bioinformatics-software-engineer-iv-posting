work in person??!! what ... i wanted to be remote lol

commuting = 45 mins in the bus + 20 mins port auth -> 60th st, so i have to leave at 7 am every morning which is fineeee, i can do it 3x a week but not 5x a week but lets see

"i think you can do it" - you, to me, in 2017

done with one interview today, they said that the person in the comp oncology team hand picked my application to send over to HR to interview yayyy im excited, next zoom interview is next week

so its a hybird position, they want someone in the area, thats fineee, commute some days and remote some days, i can do that but not commute everyday thats too much sitting around in a car or a bus/train, maybe ill take an uber some mornings, they kept saying they were really excited about my application :)))))

midtown east apartments (bc ... maybe ... id rather spend rent money on shoes and trips to dubai though but i did enjoy my [home office setup in bethesda](https://www.herlog.com/content/images/size/w1600/2023/12/bethesda-2019.png) ... so maybeee) (it has to be within walking distance to the office building bc if i would have to take the subway, then i can just commute from home)
